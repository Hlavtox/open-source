# Sharing third-party distributions


For user safety, please do not link to or reference forks or third-party repositories of PrestaShop releases or PrestaShop distributions that are not officially maintained by the PrestaShop project team. This applies to all parts of the project, including comments, issues, pull requests, discussions, [Build Blog](https://build.prestashop-project.org/), and [Slack](https://www.prestashop-project.org/slack/).

Such links may be removed or hidden by the maintainers. Repeated promotion may result in further moderation.


Only repositories under the official [PrestaShop](https://github.com/PrestaShop) or [PrestaShopCorp](https://github.com/PrestaShopCorp) GitHub organizations, as well as the official [prestashop.com](http://prestashop.com/) website, are considered officially maintained.
