# List of third party, open source and free of charge modules and themes for the PrestaShop e-commerce solution

There are plenty of useful themes and modules available on the web from third party developers for the PrestaShop e-commerce solution. Unfortunately, there is no place currently to list them so people can find them.

So, let's build a knowledge base. If you want to contribute to this page, please create a pull request for each module or theme you would like to propose, following the example:

```
### Module/theme name
- Developer: (name of the company or developer)
- Description: (one or two lines max)
- GitHub username: @
- Keywords: (topics, features, separated by a comma)
- Source code: (like a GitHub repository link for support, issues, and source code)
- Download link: (where to find a ready to use zip file: direct link, or link to the release page of your repository, or to a page on your website where people can download the zip file)
```

The aim is to use this data as a base to create content for a dedicated website in the future. That's why respecting the template is very important, so it can be processed by a script.

To be accepted in the list, check that your modules and themes are open source and respect the intellectual property of the PrestaShop open source project:
- Licensed and distributed under AFL
- Dependencies, librairies and artwork distributed in the ZIP for installation must be in [compatible licenses](https://devdocs.prestashop-project.org/9/contribute/contribution-guidelines/compatible-licenses/)
- The terms of use don't include restrictions incompatible with the [AFL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academic_Free_License) or the [Open Source Definition](https://opensource.org/osd)
- The module is not tight to a commercial service (e.g logistic, payment)

Please keep in mind that the current rules are a proposal, and they may evolve depending on feedback and discussions.
